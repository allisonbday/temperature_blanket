# 🧶 Temperature Blanket App

## 📝 Description

This is a Streamlit app that allows you to create a temperature blanket based on the weather in your area. It uses the [Open-Metro API](https://open-meteo.com/) to get the weather data and [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to create the image.
